# Engine
[ ] Object instanciation for a map should be done via a JSON file, rather than hard coded with classes, that way the editor can be enabled to be more powerful.

# Editor
Editor is currently very limited
[ ] Enable scene preview
[ ] Enable object additions via the Editor
[ ] Rename "engine" folder to Editor as that is what it is, engine is the underly code

# Client
[ ] Base resolution should be 1920x1080

# Game Objects
[ ] Game Objects should be hierarchal

E.g. allowing for a structure as follows
```
A.Children[0].Children[0].Children[0];
```
